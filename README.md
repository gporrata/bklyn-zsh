My Powerline9k zsh theme inspired from other zsh themes. Features:

* better icons suited for nerd fonts
* rotating os icon color
* rotating theme for segment dividers:
  * regular triangular segments
  * rounded segments
  * in flame segments
  * digital1 segments
  * digital2 segments
* Nice prompt icon, even for PS2

Left segment: os_icon root_indicator context dir vcs
Right segment: status load ram background_jobs time

Rotation based on the number of zsh sessions running.

## Installation

You need zsh, [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug), [powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k), and a [nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts). The screenshot uses monofur and iterm2. You could use some other zsh plugin but imho zplug is the best.


## todo

* Segment for version of virtual environment when in a folder for that env.
* Submit to the good ppl at powerlevel9k.
