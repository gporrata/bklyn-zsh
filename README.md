# bklyn-zsh

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gporrata/bklyn-zsh/master/screenshot.png)

My own zsh theme, inspired by powerlevel9k and powerline. Requires:

* node
* yarn
* git
* nerd font

The screenshot above uses iTerm2, a nerd font, and solarized
colors. Bklyn-zsh will run on a server which provides the left and
right prompts. Just a few features including:

* nice os icons for osx, linux (ubuntu or redhat)
* nice icon for type of project language (js, scala, java, .c++)
* current git branch / up / down / stashes / unstaged icons
* last process failed / last pid
* if in ssh
* pretty colors defined in hex (thanks to npm ansi-style)

Todo:

* will provide more information on the tmux line, coming soon
* alternating powerline edges based on the day.
